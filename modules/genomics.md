# Genomics

Genomics is the study of genomes, the complete set of an organism's DNA. Genomics research now encompasses functional and structural studies, epigenomics, and metagenomics, and genomic medicine is under active implementation and extension in the health sector.

Modules linked to genomics topics are currently under construction.
