# Electronic Health Records

Electronic health records (EHRs) are digital records kept in the public health sector that record the medical histories of individuals, and access is normally highly restricted to preserve patient privacy. This data is sometimes also shared (partly or in full) in secondary patient registries that support research of a specific disease or condition (such as cystic fibrosis). These datasets are extraordinarily valuable in the development of predictive models used in precision medicine.

Modules linked to EHR analysis are currently under development.
