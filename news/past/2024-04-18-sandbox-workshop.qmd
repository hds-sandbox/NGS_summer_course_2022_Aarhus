This workshop offers an introduction to the training materials and tools of the Health Data Science Sandbox, a national infrastructure project. The Sandbox team is building training resources and guides for learning bioinformatics, predictive modeling in precision medicine, high performance computing and data carpentry that is accessible to all Danish university employees (PhD students and up) via academic supercomputing infrastructure.

You will be introduced to our current training set-up, meet our helpful data scientists, be guided through how to use our apps, and can make requests for the next topic we tackle!
