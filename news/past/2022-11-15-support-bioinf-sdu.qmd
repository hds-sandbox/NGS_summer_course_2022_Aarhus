Sandbox data scientist Jacob Fredegaard Hansen created a tutorial on how to use ColabFold for a one day workshop as part of the ['Workshops in Applied Bioinformatics'](https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=searchfagbesk&internkode=bmb209&lang=en) series taught by Sandbox collaborator Veit Schwammle. The material is accessible on the Sandbox website (see [Modules](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/modules/), Proteomics) for any UCloud user alongside the UCloud ColabFold App.
