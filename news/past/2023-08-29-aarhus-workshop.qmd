Sandbox data scientist Samuele Soraggi hosted a three day speed run through Sandbox apps at the Bioinformatics Research Center. The 26 participants joined for genomics, transcriptomics, and/or proteomics app demos depending on their interests. This thorough omics demo had maxed out participant sign-ups and an enthusiastic crew enjoyed the sessions alongside a bit of networking across disciplines. We plan to host more of these type of workshops given the event's success!
