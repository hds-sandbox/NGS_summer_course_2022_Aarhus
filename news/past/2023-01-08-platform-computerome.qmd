Sandbox data scientist Jesper Roy Christiansen has been integral to the development of a new ['Course Platform'](https://www.computerome.dk/solutions/course-platform) at Computerome, the HPC platform at the Technical University of Denmark. Built as a collaboration between the Sandbox and Computerome, the Course Platform will host its first users, students in 'Fra real-world data til personlig medicin', a course of KU's MS in Personlig Medicin. Sandbox coordinator Jennifer Bartell and Sandbox PI Martin Boegsted have also been involved in testing this new system during course setup. See the above link as well as [HPC Access](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/access) for more details on this platform and how you can also use this new platform to host courses (with or without Sandbox involvement!).
