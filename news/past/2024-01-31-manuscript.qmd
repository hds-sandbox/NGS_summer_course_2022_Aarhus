In collaboration with Prof. Henning Langberg at KU Public Health and funding from Erhvervsfyrtaarn Sund Vaegt, Jennifer Bartell has developed a manuscript that discusses technical, regulatory, and deployment solutions and challenges for synthetic health data from a broad perspective. This manuscript was developed in collaboration with Sandbox partners Sander Boisen Valentin and Martin Boegsted of AAU, and we plan to submit it to a journal soon. For now, check out [our manuscript on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17653)!
