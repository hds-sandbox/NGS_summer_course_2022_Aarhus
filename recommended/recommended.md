## Recommended Resources in Health Data Science

Many outside resources are available to support education in health data science, ranging from beginner-level introductions to R or Python (the primary languages of health data science) to other teaching resources and tutorials created at universities and life science organizations.

We encourage you to explore the training platform provided by [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) (Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data). On this platform ([TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/)), you can find a registry of training materials as well as webinars, workshops, and in-person courses in bioinformatics, modelling, data management, and life science database usage among other topics.
