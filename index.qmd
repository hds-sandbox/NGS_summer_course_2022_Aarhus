# Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing data {.centered}

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**Computing and didactical support from the [Danish Health Data Science Sandbox](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/)**
:::

## Course material

The material for this course is organized in four separated jupyter notebooks in both `bash`, `python` and `R` where you will benefit of an interactive coding setup on `jupyterlab`. Each lesson is in the menu above.

### First exercise

The first exercise lesson is executed with the web interface [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/). Click on `1.Galaxy Exercise` in the menu for instructions)

## Following exercises

The following exercise lessons will work on a computing environment with `jupyterlab`. Use `2.Instructions` to find out how to run it, selecting the computing environment you need (danish clusters `uCloud` and `GenomeDK`, your PC, or another cluster).

## Compiled exercises

if you need to have a look at the exercises as a reference, then the menu `3.Compiled exercises` contains all the compiled exercises on `jupyterlab` in a document format, from which you can also copy-paste the code.

# Course overview

:::{.callout-note icon="False" title="overview"}

After the course, you will have knowledge of bioinformatics methods for analyzing genomes using NGS data, including knowledge of the existing types of genome data, how the different types of data can be displayed and analyzed, the current methods for genome assembly and analysis, their accuracy and how they can be used. The course will enable you to devise and run a project that makes use of NGS data.

- **Prerequisites:** This is an introductory course that needs a basic understanding of the biology behind sequencing, and not necessarily programming experience (though this would help!).

- **Syllabus:**

    - Describe key challenges in the analysis of NGS data

    - Explain the theoretical foundation for methods that use NGS for assembly and analysis of genomes

    - Discuss the bioinformatic methods for genome analysis and hypothesize what drives the outcome of the methods

    - Review original literature within the subjects and relate the discussed topics to analysis scenarios

    - Apply bioinformatics tools within the selected application areas and reflect on the results, formulating your own conclusion in the proposed tasks

- **Time:** 20 hours (for reading through the code, executing it, answering questions). The material fits 4-5 days lessons.

- **Supporting Materials:**

    - jupyter notebooks for interactive coding
    - lecture slides from the instructor

You can find the links to the material in the table at the bottom of this page.
